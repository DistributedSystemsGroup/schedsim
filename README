This is our simulator for evaluating the impact of errors in
estimating the size when performing size-based scheduling in big-data
workloads. Details in our technical report, available at XXX.

Needed software:
 - wget (to get the datasets)
 - Python 3 (should also work -- untested -- with Py2.7)
 - Python libraries: numpy, matplotlib (for plots)

I got reported that this appears not to be sufficient with the Py2.7
installed by default on MacOS.

=== GET THE WORKLOADS ===

$./get_datasets
(will get the workloads from the SWIM git repository)

=== RUN THE EXPERIMENT ===

$./experiment.py filename.tsv sigma iterations [d-over-n] [load]

 - filename.tsv: the .tsv file with the trace to use
 - sigma: the sigma parameter for the log-normal error function
 - iterations: number of iterations for each run of the experiment.
   If that number of iterations is already in the results file,
   nothing will be done.
 - d-over-n: the d/n parameter (details in our technical report)
   to generate the workload starting from the .tsv file. Represents
   the ratio between disk and network bandwidth in the simulated
   cluster. Default value: 4.
 - load: the average load in the simulated cluster (details in
   our technical report). Default value: 0.9.

This will compute the sojourn times for each of the jobs in
filename.tsv using FIFO, PS, SRPT and two variants of FSP that cope
with errors (described again in our technical report). When performing
experiments, it will print the mean sojourn times for each instance of
the experiments. Since FIFO and PS do not suffer from estimation
errors and they only depend on the trace, they will be computed only
once rather than repeated depending on the number of iterations.

Results will be output in a binary file (Python's shelve format) named
'results_filename[.tsv stripped]_sigma_d-over-n_load.s'. If such a
file already exists, we simply add the results of more experiment runs
to it.

=== PLOT THE RESULTS ===

$./plot_sojourn_vs_error.py dataset d-over-n load [paper]

Produces boxplots for sojourn time vs. errors.

If the "paper" parameter is specified, .eps files will be rendered
with Latex and output as sojourn-vs-error_dataset_d-over-n_load.pdf.

---

$./plot_sojourn_vs_load.py dataset sigma d-over-n [paper]

Produces plots that shows how mean sojourn time changes according to
load.

Again, the "paper" parameter produces plots -- both for no errors
(sigma=0) and specified sigma in
sojourn-vs-load_dataset_sigma_d-over-n.pdf

---

$./plot_sojourn_vs_dn.py dataset sigma load [paper]

Exactly as above, but varying d-over-n and keeping load fixed. Output
graphs for the "paper" option will be
sojourn-vs-dn_dataset_sigma_load.pdf.
